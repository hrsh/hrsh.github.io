### ABOUT MY NAME


**MAZDAK /ˈmæz.dæk/**

The name **Mazdak** has historical and cultural significance, particularly in the context of ancient Persia (modern-day Iran). The exact etymology of the name **Mazdak** is not fully clear, but it is believed to be derived from *Middle Persian*. One possible interpretation links it to the concept of *Mazda* (as in *Ahura Mazda*, the supreme god in *Zoroastrianism*), which means wisdom or lord of wisdom. **Mazdak** was a prominent *Persian* religious leader and philosopher who lived during the *Sassanid* era in the 5th and early 6th centuries CE. He led a movement known as *Mazdakism*, which advocated for social justice, wealth redistribution, and communal living. He believed in a dualistic cosmology, emphasizing the eternal struggle between good (light) and evil (darkness), which was somewhat inspired by earlier *Zoroastrian* beliefs. **Mazdak**'s teachings emphasized the importance of equality and the sharing of resources. He opposed the excesses of the wealthy elite and sought to address social inequalities. His ideas were considered radical for the time and led to significant political and social upheaval.


### About Me

Hello! I’m Mazdak Shojaie, a passionate backend developer with a journey that has been shaped by curiosity, dedication, and a deep love for technology. My path into the world of software development began with a fascination for how things work, a curiosity that has propelled me into the dynamic field of coding.

### Early Beginnings

My academic background is rooted in engineering. I hold a Master’s degree in Structural Engineering and a Bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering. While these disciplines taught me valuable analytical skills, it was my interest in programming that truly ignited my passion for technology. I found myself drawn to the idea that software could transform the future, and I was determined to be part of that transformation.

### A Passion for Backend Development

Transitioning from structural engineering to software development was both challenging and exhilarating. I dove headfirst into languages and frameworks like C#, .NET Core, and JavaScript, immersing myself in the complexities of backend systems. My commitment to continuous learning has been vital in keeping my skills sharp and relevant in this ever-evolving industry.

Throughout my professional journey, I’ve had the privilege of working on various projects that have shaped my expertise. At **CODETECH**, I’ve been instrumental in developing decentralized applications and high-scale online exchanges using blockchain technology.
