### ABOUT MY NAME


**MAZDAK /ˈmæz.dæk/**

The name **Mazdak** has historical and cultural significance, particularly in the context of ancient Persia (modern-day Iran). The exact etymology of the name **Mazdak** is not fully clear, but it is believed to be derived from *Middle Persian*. One possible interpretation links it to the concept of *Mazda* (as in *Ahura Mazda*, the supreme god in *Zoroastrianism*), which means wisdom or lord of wisdom. **Mazdak** was a prominent *Persian* religious leader and philosopher who lived during the *Sassanid* era in the 5th and early 6th centuries CE. He led a movement known as *Mazdakism*, which advocated for social justice, wealth redistribution, and communal living. He believed in a dualistic cosmology, emphasizing the eternal struggle between good (light) and evil (darkness), which was somewhat inspired by earlier *Zoroastrian* beliefs. **Mazdak**'s teachings emphasized the importance of equality and the sharing of resources. He opposed the excesses of the wealthy elite and sought to address social inequalities. His ideas were considered radical for the time and led to significant political and social upheaval.
